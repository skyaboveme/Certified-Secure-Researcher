				<section class="intro-section">
					<p class="lead">National Security Presidential Memorandum 33 (NSPM-33) represents the most significant shift in federal research security policy in decades. For research institutions and individual researchers, understanding these requirements isn't optional—it's essential for maintaining access to federal funding and protecting your institution's reputation.</p>

					<p>This guide breaks down the key requirements of NSPM-33, explains what they mean for your institution, and provides practical strategies for achieving and maintaining compliance.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What is NSPM-33?</h2>
					<p>NSPM-33, formally titled "United States Government-Supported Research and Development National Security Policy," was signed in January 2021 and provides implementation guidance released by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). It establishes a comprehensive framework for protecting federally funded research from foreign government interference while maintaining the open research environment essential for scientific progress.</p>

					<div class="key-points-box">
						<h4>Key Objectives of NSPM-33:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Strengthen protections for U.S. government-supported R&D against foreign interference</li>
							<li>Standardize disclosure requirements across federal funding agencies</li>
							<li>Clarify roles and responsibilities for researchers and institutions</li>
							<li>Promote research security while preserving international collaboration</li>
							<li>Establish consistent approaches to risk assessment and mitigation</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div class="highlight-box">
						<p><strong>Important Context:</strong> NSPM-33 is not about limiting legitimate international collaboration. It's about ensuring transparency and protecting sensitive research from exploitation by foreign governments seeking to gain unfair advantages through inappropriate means.</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>The Four Pillars of NSPM-33</h2>
					<p>NSPM-33 is built on four interconnected pillars that together create a comprehensive research security framework:</p>

					<div class="pillar-grid">
						<div class="pillar-card">
							<div class="pillar-number">1</div>
							<div class="pillar-content">
								<h3>Disclosure Requirements</h3>
								<p>Standardized requirements for researchers to disclose current and pending support, affiliations, and other commitments that could affect federally funded research.</p>
								<div class="pillar-details">

								</div>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="pillar-card">
							<div class="pillar-number">2</div>

							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Disclosure Requirements in Detail</h2>
					<p>The disclosure requirements are often the most directly impactful aspect of NSPM-33 for individual researchers. Understanding exactly what must be disclosed is critical for compliance.</p>

					<div class="disclosure-category">
						<h3>Current and Pending Support</h3>
						<p>Researchers must disclose all current and pending sources of support, including:</p>
						<div class="disclosure-grid">
							<div class="disclosure-item">
								<span class="disclosure-icon">💰</span>
								<div>
									<strong>Financial Support</strong>
									<p>All research funding regardless of source, including foreign government support</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="disclosure-item">
								<span class="disclosure-icon">🔬</span>
								<div>
									<strong>In-Kind Contributions</strong>
									<p>Equipment, supplies, personnel, or other non-monetary support for research</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="disclosure-item">
								<span class="disclosure-icon">📅</span>
								<div>
									<strong>Time Commitments</strong>
									<p>All professional appointments and their associated time commitments</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="disclosure-item">
								<span class="disclosure-icon">🏢</span>
								<div>
									<strong>Institutional Affiliations</strong>
									<p>All positions at other institutions, including visiting appointments</p>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="disclosure-category">
						<h3>Participation in Foreign Talent Programs</h3>
						<p>Special attention is given to foreign government-sponsored talent recruitment programs, which may:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Require transfer of intellectual property to foreign entities</li>
							<li>Create conflicting obligations with U.S. funding requirements</li>
							<li>Involve undisclosed compensation or support</li>
							<li>Restrict publication or sharing of research results</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div class="warning-box">
						<h4>Common Disclosure Mistakes to Avoid:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Omitting "small" or "informal" foreign appointments</li>
							<li>Failing to disclose support that doesn't involve direct payment</li>
							<li>Not updating disclosures when circumstances change</li>
							<li>Assuming institutional knowledge substitutes for formal disclosure</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Institutional Requirements</h2>
					<p>NSPM-33 places significant responsibilities on research institutions, not just individual researchers. Institutions receiving substantial federal research funding must:</p>

					<h2>The Role of Digital Persistent Identifiers</h2>
					<p>NSPM-33 emphasizes the use of digital persistent identifiers, with ORCiD being the primary standard. Here's why this matters:</p>

					<div class="identifier-benefits">
						<div class="benefit-row">
							<div class="benefit-card">
								<div class="benefit-icon">🔗</div>
								<h4>Unique Identification</h4>
								<p>ORCiD provides a unique, persistent identifier that follows researchers throughout their careers, eliminating confusion from name variations or institutional changes.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="benefit-card">
								<div class="benefit-icon">📊</div>
								<h4>Comprehensive Tracking</h4>
								<p>Enables accurate tracking of all research activities, publications, and funding across an entire career.</p>
